## Who are we?

We're the founders of [720developments.com](http://720developments.com), as you can see if you google us, we're a engaged couple that is working with web developments together since we're just 21 years old (and dating since we're just 17). 7 years later since we starting on our own, we are still here, doing the same but in more interesting projects, trying to learn as much as we can in our free time, and trying to travel as much as we can with our budget.
Also we love to eat, drink good beer (we may start making our own next year) and walk long distances talking about, well... anything, with our 3 little dogs next to us.

## What are we going to do?
**Theme:** As for the moment of the themes been launched, we choose *Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization*, however, after looking at the APIs, we decided to create a learning tool based in free videos from Youtube users. The theme is HTML5 games, but as we don't do HTML5 games (and we really really want to develop this idea), we've created a web based tool that fetches videos of your interests from Youtube related to Freebase topics focused on education and hobbies. 

We believe the future of education is in the web, and with this project we want to take advantage of Freebase database and the connection the Google guys have been made with the Youtube API and show great content to the end users, as right now Youtube is not very friendly for using as learning tool.

Also we complemented this with some other information from Freebase to get education topics related to the topic you want to learn, for example: books, films and careers. Maybe your hobby can become your career, and this is the real reason behind this project.

## Hobbies and Careers
The project called Hobbies and Careers not just wants to create a learning source from youtube, but also contribute to Freebase to get better relationships between topics and videos. That's why we have created the possibility of add boards for the users to save their favorite videos, kinda like Pinterest does, and after when we have lot of users, we will start clustering this information and send relationship requests between videos and topics to Youtube. 

Also the plan is to improve this to create a more broad system of recommendations (Universities, Professors, People to follow in the social media, etc). But oh well, 2 days is a limited time hehe. I hope you can enjoy our system as we enjoy doing it.

## Why are we participating?
Is the first time in a hackathon together, and the reasons are several, I'll enumerate the most important ones:

* We have a bit more of time this year, and we think is a fun way to spend a weekend.
* We think we're in a good moment as developers to do something great in just 2 days. 
* We get surprised by the big amount of APIs out there with awesome information, and is a good excuse to play with them.
* We will love to show our work to the great jury, having some chance to get to talk with some of them, is really the great prize of this competition.
