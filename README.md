## Who are we?

We're the founders of [720developments.com](http://720developments.com), as you can see in our webpage, we're a couple that is working with web developments together since we're just 21 years old (and dating since we're just 17). 7 years later since we starting on our own, we are still here, doing the same but in more interesting projects, trying to learn as much as we can in our free time, and trying to travel as much as we can with our budget.
Also we love to eat, drink good beer (we may start making our own next year) and walk long distances talking about, well, anything, with our 3 little dogs.

## What are we going to do?
**Theme:** Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization.
We will focus in using an API to gather data about different problematics we're (as humanity) facing in this moment. 
We're going to try to do so in a simpler manner, so everyone can read clearly what's going on.

We choose that because we think that we are in the era of knowledge, because we have tons of data collected,
and every year more and more people is accessing to the internet.
Having companies focusing on getting objective data to show to the people instead of having just a few organizations 
deciding what information to show us, is a great step to get to a global agreement of how to manage our resources and
efforts to build a better and more equal world.

Also we think about learning tools, because we believe the future of education is in the web, but we prefer the
other theme better as we think they're already great tools out there that are doing very good right now.

## Why are we participating?
Is the first time in a hackaton together, and the reasons are several, I'll enumerate the most important ones:

* We have a bit more of time this year, and we think is a fun way to spend a weekend.
* We think we're in a good moment as developers to do something great in just 2 days. 
* We get surprised by the big amount of APIs out there with awesome information, and is a good excuse to play with them.
* We will love to show our work to the great jury, having some chance to get to talk with some of them, is really the great prize of this competition.
